# Parallel Worlds - Multi-user Co-located Handheld AR
The main goal of this research project is to provide a first running demo of the Parallel Worlds Project in a large indoor space. 
This should happen in a way that allows for later reuse and expansion.

The demo should encompass a simple world simulation, that can be viewed and interacted with by multiple AR capable devices, like smartphones or tablets, at the same time. 
For that a consistent tracking solution, as well as an appropriate multi-user solution needs to be developed. 
All of that should be built using the Unity game engine.

Generally, the resulting software solution should allow for easy expandability and modification. 
In order to achieve that the project should be structured appropriately, while still being well integrated into existing systems provided by Unity.
